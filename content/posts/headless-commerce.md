this theme is now available on github for free. it's a shopify + gatsby starter theme for digital commerce, developed by [ecomloop](https://ecomloop.com).

we developed this starter theme to help shopify merchants deliver the best experience to customers by utilizing the ultra-fast [GatbyJS framework](https://gatsbyjs.org) while managing products and orders in shopify - the best of modern headless commerce.

this site currently features a demo catalog based on shopify's dummy product data. all product data is pulled from shopify at build time.
